To see code:

In root folder, open MAT500Project2.sln

OR

Look in Assets/Scripts.

To import into Unity:

1. Open new Unity project and import unitypackage called "MAT500Project3", located in root folder.

Note:

In C#, Vector3 uses floats by default, which I could not change to doubles.
Due to this, at a high number of points like 20, the curve does not exactly overlap with the last point.
